# Machine_Learning_mini_projects
This repository contains code for the following projects:

## EM Signal Distance Prediction Model: 
The implementation of a machine learning model that accurately predicts the distance of the origin of a particular electromagnetic signal, such as radio waves, using appropriate feature engineering techniques.

## Lithium-ion Compound Crystal Structure Classification: 
The implementation of a machine learning model that achieves an accuracy of 75% in predicting the crystal structure type (monoclinic, orthorhombic, triclinic) of Lithium-ion physical and chemical compounds. This project highlights exceptional data analysis and machine learning skills.

## Polymer Viscosity Prediction based on Melt Flow Rate (MFR): 
The implementation of a model that measures the Melt Flow Rate (MFR) to determine the polymer viscosity based on reactor conditions.


### Each project has its own folder that contains the following subdirectories:

data: This directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the models.

notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

README.md: This file contains a brief description of the project
